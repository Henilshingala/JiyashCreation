In the admin panel, create a "CarouselSlider model" that allows uploading an image, adding a title with customizable color, a subtitle with customizable color, a button name, a button link (href), and a button color, with all fields fully editable. Create a "Category model" with predefined options: Gold, Silver, and Imitation, with an "is_active" Boolean field to show only active categories on the website. For each main category, create respective category and subcategory models: "GoldCategories" and "GoldSubcategories", "SilverCategories" and "SilverSubcategories", "ImitationCategories" and "ImitationSubcategories", where the admin can add/remove category names (e.g., Ring, Necklace, Earring, Bracelet, Chain, etc.), assign a single image per category and subcategory, and allow multiple subcategories under each category via dropdown selection. For products, create "GoldProducts", "SilverProducts", and "ImitationProducts" models, each with fields for product name, description, up to 3 images (50MB max each), one video (.gif allowed, max 100MB), category and subcategory dropdowns, original and selling price, weight in grams, carat/metal purity or material details, stock quantity, and an "is_active" Boolean; if stock reaches zero, the product auto-hides, and only active products display on the website. Add a "DiscountCode model" with a code (varchar), discount percentage, and "is_valid" Boolean to control valid usage during payment. Include a "User model" storing login details: first name, last name, email, phone, birth date, street number and name, city, state, pincode, password, confirm password, and gender. Include a "CountryMultiplier model" where admin can define multipliers for product prices by login country (e.g., India ×1, Others ×3), editable anytime. Create "Wishlist", "Cart", "Order", and "Payment" models to track user wishlisted products, cart products, ordered products, and payment information respectively. Finally, add a "Review model" allowing users to select a product from a dropdown, enter review heading, description, optional image, and a star rating (1–5), with all submitted reviews stored and manageable via the admin panel.
